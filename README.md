# friendFinder
### friendFinder is a fullstack application built using express, node, bootstrap, and more. It will be deployed to Heroku later on.

The purpose of friendFinder is to match people based upon similar qualities. The HTML was written by someone else but the point of the project was to get some experience with express.
